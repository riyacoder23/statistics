        "2. Median = Median is the middle value present in the data and is arranged in descending or ascending order .it is less affected by extreme values and provides a centeral value for skewed disstribution.\n",

        "2. Variance : Variance is the squared differences between data point and the variance.it determines how the individual data vary from the mean.\n",
